# INTERFACES

Interfaces are verbs, they do something.

Syntactic way to have multiple structure do the same thing differently.
Implementing the same verb in a different way.

It makes your code cleaner.

## BASIC FORMATS

End interface names with `er`.

```go
type name interface {
    methodName()
    ...
}
```
