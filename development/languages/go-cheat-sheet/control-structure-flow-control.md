# CONTROL STRUCTURES / FLOW CONTROL

A control structure analyzes variables and chooses a direction
in which to go based on given parameters.
Loops and if, then, else statements are perfect examples.

## LOOPS

For loop basic format,

```go
for i:=0; i < 8; i++ {
    do something
}
```

While loop,

```go
i :=0
for i < 8 {
    do something
    i++
}
```

Do while,

```go
???
```

## CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS /  DECISION MAKING

* if
* if...else
* nested if
* switch
* select
