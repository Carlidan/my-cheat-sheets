# GO CHEAT SHEET

`go` _is an open source language developed by google. Its concurrency
mechanisms allows Apps to get the most out of multi core and
networked systems._

*** THIS CHEAT SHEET IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION - CHECK BACK SOON ***

This is a very abbreviated cheat-sheet highlighting the main
syntax of go. I have lots go examples in my appropriately named repo
[my-go-examples](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-go-examples).
