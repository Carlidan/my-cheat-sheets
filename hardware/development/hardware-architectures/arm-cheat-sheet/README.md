# ARM CHEAT SHEET

`ARM` _architecture is is a family of reduced instruction
set computing (RISC) architectures for computer processors._

View my entire list of cheat sheets on
[my GitHub Webpage](https://jeffdecola.github.io/my-cheat-sheets/).

## ARM HOLDINGS LICENSE

Arm Holdings develops CPU IP cores based on architecture
and licenses it to other companies, who design their own products.

## WHY USE SAME ARCHITECTURE

The benefit of using the same HW architecture is
everyone can use the same software library for an OS distribution.

For example, ubuntu on a Hummingboard can get software from
the ARM7 distro.

## ARM CORES USE ARM ARCHITECTURE

This highlights the main cores and the architecture used.
