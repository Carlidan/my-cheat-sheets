### VISUAL OVERVIEW OF SOFTWARE CREATING A SERVICE

Here is my concept on how various Apps and tools fit together
for the goal of creating a service,

## MY GITHUB WEBPAGE IS UPDATED USING CONCOURSE

For fun, I use concourse to automatically update
[my GitHub Webpage](https://jeffdecola.github.io/my-cheat-sheets/) and alert me of
the changes via repo status and slack.

The update is accomplished this by copying and editing
this `README.md` file to `/docs/_includes/README.md`.
You can see the concourse task (a shell script) that does this
[here](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/ci/scripts/readme-github-pages.sh).

A pipeline file [pipeline.yml](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/ci/pipeline.yml)
shows the entire ci flow. Visually, it looks like,

For more information on using concourse for continuous integration,
refer to my cheat sheet on [concourse](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/software/operations-tools/continuous-integration-continuous-deployment/concourse-cheat-sheet).
