`my-cheat-sheets` _is a place to keep my cheat sheets
for various apps and tools for the goal of creating a service._

I organized everything into three main sections,

* DEVELOPMENT
* INFRASTRUCTURE AS A SERVICE
* OPERATIONS TOOLS

A lot of these cheat sheets has info I gathered from other sources.

## VISUAL OVERVIEW

Here is my concept on how various apps and tools together
for the goal of creating a service.

## MY GITHUB WEBPAGE UPDATED USING CONCOURSE

For fun, a concourse pipeline automatically updates
[my GitHub Webpage](https://jeffdecola.github.io/my-cheat-sheets/).

Its does the update by copying (with a little editing)
this README.md file to `/docs/_includes/README.md`.
You can see concourse task
[here](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/ci/scripts/readme-github-pages.sh).

![IMAGE - my-cheat-sheets concourse ci pipeline - IMAGE](docs/pics/my-cheat-sheets-pipeline.jpg)

A _ci/.credentials.yml_ file needs to be created for your _slack_url_ and _repo_github_token_.

Use fly to upload the the pipeline file _ci/pipeline.yml_ to concourse:

```bash
fly -t ci set-pipeline -p my-cheat-sheets -c ci/pipeline.yml --load-vars-from ci/.credentials.yml
```

`my-cheat-sheets` also contains a few extra concourse resources:

* A resource (_resource-slack-alert_) uses a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/cfcommunity/slack-notification-resource)
  that will notify slack on your progress.
* A resource (_resource-repo-status_) use a [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/dpb587/github-status-resource)
  that will update your git status for that particular commit.
