# CREATE A CUSTOM IMAGE USING AWS CLI CHEAT SHEET

`create a custom image using aws cli` _is a way
to create a custom image on `ec2`._

View my entire list of cheat sheets on
[my GitHub Webpage](https://jeffdecola.github.io/my-cheat-sheets/).

## OVERVIEW

I personally do not like this way since it requires a
lot of steps that are not that script friendly.

Use
[create custom image using packer](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/software/service-architectures/infrastructure-as-a-service/amazon-elastic-compute-cloud-cheat-sheet/amazon-elastic-compute-cloud-create-image-packer.md)
instead.
