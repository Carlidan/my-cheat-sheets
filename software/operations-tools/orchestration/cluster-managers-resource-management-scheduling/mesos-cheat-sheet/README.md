## OVERVIEW (MESOS, MESOSPHERE & MESOS DC/OS)

`Mesos` is a project by Apache that gives you the
ability to run both containerized, and non-containerized
workloads in a distributed manner.
mesos is complicated and hard to manage, so mesosphere
tries to make mesos into something understandable.

`Mesosphere` has a marathon “plugin” to mesos, which is an
easy way to manage container orchestration over mesos.

`Mesos DC/OS` (Data Center Operating System) simplifies mesos
even further and allows you to deploy your own mesos cluster,
with marathon, in a matter of minutes.
