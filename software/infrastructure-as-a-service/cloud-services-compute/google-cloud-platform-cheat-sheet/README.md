## GOOGLE CLOUD SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT (SDK)

[Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/)
is a command-line interface for Google Cloud
Platform products and services.

These include,

* `gcloud`
  [doc](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/),
  [reference](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/)
  provides the primary command-line tool for Google Cloud Platform.
* `gsutil`
  [doc](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil),
  is the command-line tool for
  [google cloud storage](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-cheat-sheets/tree/master/software/infrastructure-as-a-service/cloud-services-compute/google-cloud-platform-cheat-sheet/google-cloud-storage.md).
* `bg`
  [doc](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/bq-command-line-tool),
  is the command-line tool for BigQuery.

## INSTALL AND CONFIGURE THE gcloud SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT KIT (SDK)

There is great documentation online to install the SDK on your
particular platform [here](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/).

After installation configure,

```bash
gcloud init
```

You will be asked to attached a GCP project and a default compute region.
When complete, check your active configuration,

```bash
gcloud config list
gcloud auth list
gcloud info
```

Your configuration file is located `~/.boto`.

To change your default region/zone,

```bash
gcloud config set compute/region NAME
gcloud config set compute/zone NAME
```

For more information on the configuration file `.boto` go
[here](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil/commands/config).

## SOME BASIC GCP COMMANDS

GCP Help,

```bash
gcloud help
```

Version,

```bash
gcloud -v
```
