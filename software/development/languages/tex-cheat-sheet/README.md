## TeX

`TeX` is an advanced typesetting system which was
developed by Donald Knuth in 1978. TeX is mainly popular
because of its ability to handle complex technical
text and in displaying mathematical formula.

## LaTeX

A set of macros built on top of Tex. Built back int he 80s.
LaTeX is designed for the content, not the look of the document.
A LaTeX editor is an app which enables you to write,
edit and publish your paper in LaTeX.


```
\documentclass{article}
\title{Cartesian closed categories and the price of eggs}
\author{Jane Doe}
\date{September 1994}
\begin{document}
   \maketitle
   Hello world!
\end{document}
```

But I am only interested in the mathematical formulas.
Typesetting mathematics is one of LaTeX's greatest strengths.

## KaTeX

Displays mathematical notation in web browsers.
