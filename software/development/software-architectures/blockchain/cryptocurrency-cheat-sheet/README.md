## OVERVIEW

To understand cryptocurrency you must understand blockchain.

A blockchain is a new kind of infrastructure software. From a developerâ€™s
perspective you can create an immutable history of transactions on a
blockchain. Once those transactions are stored on a blockchain, it
is guaranteed that those transactions will not be deleted, modified,
or forged without a trace of the action.

## TOP CURRENCIES

There are hundreds of currencies, these are my favorites.

### BITCOIN (BTC)

* Hash: SHA-256 Based

Bitcoins can be mined every 10 minutes.
Every 4 years that number gets cut in half.
It ends in 2140 at 21,000,000 bitcoins.

### DAI (DAI)

* Hash: Not sure
* Dai is always worth $1 USD each
* Anyone with an Ethereum wallet can own, accept, and transfer it
* It can be exchanged without any middleman

### EOS (EOS)

* [eos.io](https://eos.io/)
* Hash: Not sure
* Built for both public and private use
* Written in C++
* The protocol emulates most of the attributes of a real computer
  CPU, RAM.

### ETHEREUM (ETH)

* Hash:  Based

### LITECOIN (LTC)

* Hash:  Based

### STELLAR LUMENS (XLM)

* Hash:  Based
* Transactions take only 5 seconds
* Transactions cost a tiny fraction of a penny
* Stellar does not burn mountains of fossil fuels (see Ethereum or Bitcoin)
* A person can send a token or currency to another user, magically
  transforming it to a different token in the process.

### Zcash (ZEC)

Did not use 3rd, party but installed their Wallet on stimpy from
[here](https://z.cash/download/)

## WALLETS & EXCHANGE

There is a difference.

### WALLET

A Wallet has the ability to,

* Send
* Receive

Pros,

* You can use your bitcoin.

### EXCHANGE

The ability to,

* Buy
* Sell
* Convert

Pros,

* Get money in and out of bitcoin.

### HYBRID

Like coinbase, its a mix of the two and it can be confusing.

### PRIVATE AND PUBLIC WALLETS

A `Private Wallet` is just that, private.
You have a wallet address.  You own that address.
A private wallet is one which the individual fully controls
(has custody of) both the public and private keys.

For example, here is a private wallet for XLM Lumens,
[Stellar Lumens (XLM) Private Wallet](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/account/GBKIQHJT7QP6JVLQZRHR7XQMKBFCN5ZCB5BZMEAGVTTZIJTBBZANMTK5)

A `Public Wallet` is just that, used by many people.
But you now need a unique identifier to determine who you are,
hence a Destination Tag/Memo. Coinbase uses Public Wallets.
