## OVERVIEW

To understand cryptocurrency you must understand blockchain.

A blockchain is a new kind of infrastructure software. From a developerâ€™s
perspective you can create an immutable history of transactions on a
blockchain. Once those transactions are stored on a blockchain, it
is guaranteed that those transactions will not be deleted, modified,
or forged without a trace of the action.

## TOP CURRENCIES

There are hundreds of currencies, these are my favorites.

### BITCOIN (BTC)

## PRIVATE & PUBLIC WALLETS

A `Private Wallet` is just that, private.
You have a wallet address.  You own that address.
A private wallet is one which the individual fully controls
(has custody of) both the public and private keys.

For example, here is a private wallet for XLM Lumens,
[Stellar Lumens (XLM) Private Wallet](https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/account/GBKIQHJT7QP6JVLQZRHR7XQMKBFCN5ZCB5BZMEAGVTTZIJTBBZANMTK5)

A `Public Wallet` is just that, used by many people.
But you now need a unique identifier to determine who you are
that is called a Destination Tag/Memo. Coinbase uses Public Wallets.

## EXCHANGE

The Ability to buy and sell currency.
