# HASHING CHEAT SHEET

`hashing` _is changing a message into an unreadable string not for
the purpose of hiding the message, but more for verifying the
contents of the message. Finding the message `fingerprint`._

There are three main types of cryptography,

## OVERVIEW

Cryptography is the art of changing a message from a readable format,
referred to as `plaintext`, into an unreadable one, or `ciphertext`.

Two common hashing algorithms are MD5 and SHA.
