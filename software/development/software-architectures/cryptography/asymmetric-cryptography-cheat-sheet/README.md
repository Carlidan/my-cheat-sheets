# ASYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY CHEAT SHEET

`asymmetric-cryptography` _uses a public key to encrypt a message
and a private key to decrypt._

There are three main types of cryptography,

## OVERVIEW

Cryptography is the art of changing a message from a readable format,
referred to as `plaintext`, into an unreadable one, or `ciphertext`.

Asymmetric cryptography uses two separate keys,

* A public key is used to encrypt the messages
* A private key is used to then decrypt the message

This is used all over the web for ssl, tls, pgp, ssh, etc...
