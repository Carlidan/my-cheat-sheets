# SYMMETRIC CRYPTOGRAPHY CHEAT SHEET

_`Symmetric cryptography` uses one key to both encrypt
and a decrypt a message._

There are three main types of cryptography,

## OVERVIEW

Cryptography is the art of changing a message from a readable format,
referred to as `plaintext`, into an unreadable one, or `ciphertext`.

Symmetric cryptography uses a single key to encrypt and decrypt a message.

This illustration from my go example
[aes-256](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-go-examples/tree/master/cryptography/symmetric-cryptography/aes-256)
may help,
