## GEORGE WASHINGTON & THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR (1754-1763)

Right before this time, there were lots of wars over land.
The English basically  had the east coast, and french had the
midwest and lots of disputed areas in between.

The english didn't want the french building forts so King George
sent a british Colonel George Washington and started the long
`French and Indian War` (1754-1763).

At the peace treaty france gave up all of its territories in
North America.  But this was at a huge cost and they needed money.
So they wanted to get money from the colonies.

## THE SUGAR, STAMP, DECLARATORY & TOWNSHEND ACTS (1764-1767)

To help pay for the war Britain needed money and wanted the colonies to
pay them back for the expensive wars. In 1764 they introduced the `sugar act`.
This forced the colonies to import sugar and molasses from Britain and
pay a duty on them.  Then in 1764 they introduced the `stamp act` which would actually
put stamps on things, really tax anything the colonies did.

They colonists were mad because they didn't have any representation
in parliament and they were being taxed. They protested
and British goods were boycotted so Britain repealed the stamp act because of this.

But they still needed money so in 1766 the british introduced tried again and
introduced the `declaratory act` and the 1767 `Townshend Acts`
that pretty much taxed everything on import duties.

Once again, the colonists got mad and boycotted goods so the
townshend act was repealed in 1770. But they kept a tea tax and
sent 1,000 troops to Boston to take control.
The merchants of Boston circumvented the act by continuing to receive
tea smuggled in by Dutch traders.

## THE BOSTON MASSACRE (MARCH 5, 1770)

The Boston Massacre, known to the British as the `Incident on King Street`,
was a confrontation on March 5, 1770 in which British soldiers shot
and killed several people while being harassed by a mob in Boston.
The event was heavily publicized by leading Patriots such as
`Paul Revere` and `Samuel Adams`.

The anger continued to grow over the next few years.

## THE BOSTON TEA PARTY (December 16, 1773)

In 1773 Parliament passed a `Tea Act` designed to aid the
financially troubled East India Company by granting it a monopoly on
all tea exported to the colonies and an exemption on the export tax.
The company thus could sell the tea at a less-than-usual price in either
America or Britain; it could undersell anyone else.

An incident in which 342 chests of tea belonging to the British East India
Company were thrown from ships into Boston Harbor by 60 American
patriots disguised as Mohawk Indians. The Americans were protesting both
a tax on tea (taxation without representation) and the perceived
monopoly of the East India Company.

In retaliation, Parliament passed the series of punitive measures
known in the colonies as the `Intolerable Acts` and sent more troops.
Boston ws no under control of britain.

## FIRST CONTINENTAL CONGRESS (Fall 1774)

Seeing the Boston was under Britain's control, the remaining colonies held
the First Continental Congress at Carpenter's Hall in Philadelphia, from
September 5, to October 26, 1774. The colonies were united in a
determination to show a combined authority to Great Britain.

On October 14, the `Declaration and Resolves` established
the course of the congress, as a statement of principles
common to all of the colonies. Congress voted to meet
again the following year if these grievances were not
attended to by England.

56 delegates were there such as Famous people like John Adams,
Samuel Adams, Robert Treat Paine and George Washington were there.

But the british would not stop, so they armed the colonists and
these minutemen were ready at a moments notice.

## PAUL REVERE FAMOUS RIDE (April 18, 1775)

Britain wanted to shut down the rebels so in 1775 the british lead
by British General Thomas Gage started marching to Concord to
arrest Samuel Adams and John Hancock. They also
wanted to seize weapons and gun powder being stored in Concord.

Around midnight Paul Revere was instructed by the Sons of
Liberty to ride to Lexington, Mass. to warn them and
the minute men could get ready.

## THE SHOT HEARD ROUND THE WORLD (April 19, 1775)

The british marched into the small town of Lexington
around 5:00 am to find, facing them, a militia company of
more 70 men led by Captain John Parker.

At some point a shot rang out-- historians still debate who fired
the shot. The nervous British soldiers fired a volley,
killing seven and mortally wounding one of the retreating militiamen.
The British column moved on towards Concord, leaving the dead,
wounded, and dying in their wake. Parker and his men would
have revenge later that afternoon.

Arriving in Concord around 8:00 am, with about 220 troops in all,
to secured the north bridge across the Concord River.

The Acton Company, commanded by thirty-year old Captain Isaac Davis,
wanted to stop the British. When Davis’s company came within range,
British soldiers opened fire, killing Isaac Davis. The Minute Men replied with
their own volley, killing three British soldiers and
wounding nine others. This volley is the volley considered
`the shot heard round the world`. The rest of the British troops
retreated back to Boston.  This marked the start of the war for
independence.

## THE GREEN MOUNTAIN BOYS & FORT TICONDEROGA (May 10, 1775)

in capturing Fort Ticonderoga. Allen quickly and enthusiastically agreed.

The Green Mountain Boys, along with Arnold and his small troop,

the rebellion.

to send troops from Boston to occupy the hills surrounding
the city, some 1,000 colonial militiamen under Colonel William
Prescott (1726-95) built earthen fortifications on top of Breed’s Hill,
overlooking Boston and located on the Charlestown Peninsula.

As the British advanced in columns against the Americans, Prescott,
in an effort to conserve the Americans’ limited supply of ammunition,
reportedly told his men, `Don’t fire until you see the whites of their eyes!`
When the Redcoats were within several dozen yards, the Americans
let loose with a lethal barrage of musket fire, throwing the British into retreat.

The British defeated the Americans at the Battle of Bunker
Hill in Massachusetts. Despite their loss, the inexperienced
colonial forces inflicted significant casualties against the enemy,
and the battle provided them with an important confidence boost.
Although commonly referred to as the Battle of Bunker Hill,
most of the fighting occurred on nearby Breed’s Hill.

## EARLY WAR (1775)
