`algebra` _finding out what the unknown is._

[my GitHub Webpage](https://jeffdecola.github.io/my-cheat-sheets/).

## OVERVIEW - THE UNKNOWN

Algebra is a lot like arithmetic.
But algebra introduces the element of unknown values,

$$
1 + 2 = unknown
$$

or

$$
1 + 2 = x
$$

Where $x$ is a placeholder for a number we don't know yet.
The equation is telling us the known and unknown values.

One of the main goals of algebra is to `solve the equation`.
To find out what the unknown is,

$$
\begin{aligned}
1 + 2 =& x \\
3 =& x \\
x =& 3
\end{aligned}
$$

## VARIABLES

$$
a + b = 2
$$

If $a = 2$, then $b = 0$.  If $a = 1$, then $b = 1$. Hence $b$ will change depending on $a$.
And visa versa.

## MULTIPLICATION IS IMPLIED

Instead of,

$$
a \times b + c\times d=10
$$

Its easier to do,

$$
ab + cd = 10
$$

Since we do grouping,

$$
(a+b)(c+d)=10
$$

We can use that for multiplication on numbers. So instead of,

$$
2 \times 5 = 10
$$

Its cleaner to do,

$$
2(5) = 10
$$

## SOLVE SIMPLE EQUATIONS WITH ONE OPERATION (REARRANGEMENT)

Figuring out the unknowns via rearrangement.  Equations
must always by balanced.  Just do the same things to both sides
of the equation.

Addition (_add 5 on each side_),

$$
\begin{aligned}
x-5 =& 16 \\
(5)+x-5 =& 16+(5) \\
x =& 21
\end{aligned}
$$

Subtraction _(subtract 7 from each side)_,

$$
\begin{aligned}
x+7 =& 15 \\
(-7)+x+7 =& 15+(-7) \\
x =& 8
\end{aligned}
$$

Dealing with $-x$, _(add $x$ on each side)_,

$$
\begin{aligned}
12-x =& 5 \\
(x) + 12-x =& 5 + (x)  \\
12 =& 5+x \\
(-5)+12 =& 5+x+(-5) \\
7 =& x \\
x =& 7
\end{aligned}
$$ 

Division _(divide by 3 on each side)_,

$$
\begin{aligned}
3x =& 15 \\
\frac{3x}{(3)} =& \frac{15}{(3)} \\
x =& 5 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Multiplication with $x$ on the top _(multiply by 2 on each side)_,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{x}{2} =& 3 \\
(2)\frac{x}{2} =& 3(2) \\
x =& 6
\end{aligned}
$$

Multiplication with $x$ on the bottom _(multiply by x on each side)_,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{4}{x} =& 2 \\
(x)\frac{4}{x} =& 2(x) \\
4 =& 2x \\
\frac{4}{(2)} =& \frac{2x}{(2)} \\
2 =& x \\
x =& 2
\end{aligned}
$$

## SOLVE SIMPLE EQUATIONS WITH TWO OPERATIONS (REARRANGEMENT)

Also called 2-step equations.  When solving multi step operations
use the oder of operations rule in reverse, which is,

* $()$ and Groups
* Exponents and Radicals
* $\div$ $\times$
* $+$ $-$

Multiplication & Addition _(use subtraction and then division)_,

$$
\begin{aligned}
2x + 2 =& 8 \\
(-2) + 2x + 2 =& 8 + (-2) \\
2x =& 6 \\
\frac{2x}{(2)} =& \frac{6}{(2)} \\
x =& 3
\end{aligned}
$$

Division & Subtraction _(use addition and then multiplication)_,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{x}{2}-1 =& 4 \\
(1)+\frac{x}{2}-1 =& 4+(1) \\
\frac{x}{2} =& 5 \\
(2)\frac{x}{2} =& 5(2) \\
x =& 10
\end{aligned}
$$

Groups _(Do groups last)_,

$$
\begin{aligned}
2(x+2) =& 8 \\
\frac{2(x+2)}{(2)} =& \frac{8}{(2)} \\
(x+2) =& 4\\
x+2 =& 4\\
(-2)+x+2 =& 4 +(-2)\\
x =& 2
\end{aligned}
$$

Groups are implied both above and below fraction line _(Do groups last)_,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{x-1}{2} =& 4 \\
(2)\frac{x-1}{2} =& 4(2) \\
x-1 =& 8 \\
(1)+x-1 =& 8+(1) \\
x =& 9
\end{aligned}
$$

## SOLVE SIMPLE EQUATIONS WITH EXPONENTS & ROOTS (REARRANGEMENT)

As we mentioned before algebra is similar to arithmetic,

$$
\begin{gathered}
4^2 \quad in \; algebra \quad x^2 \\
\sqrt{16} \quad in \; algebra \quad \sqrt{x}
\end{gathered}
$$

As a side note, that will help us later on, $x^0 = 1$ and $x^1 = x$.

Square Root _(Use exponent of 2)_,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sqrt{x} =& 3 \\
(\sqrt{x})^2 =& (3)^2 \\
x =& 9
\end{aligned}
$$

Cube Root _(Use exponent of 3)_,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\sqrt[3]{x} =& 5 \\
(\sqrt[3]{x})^3 =& (5)^3 \\
x =& 125
\end{aligned}
$$

Exponent 2nd power _(Use square root)_,

$$
\begin{aligned}
x^2 =& 36 \\
\sqrt{x^2} =& \sqrt{36} \\
x =& \pm6
\end{aligned}
$$

Remember, the square root of a number can be both positive and negative.
$\sqrt{36} = 6$ because $6\times6 = 36$
But $(-6)*(-6)=36$. So it is also $\sqrt{36}=-6$.

Exponent 3rd power _(Use cube root)_,

$$
\begin{aligned}
x^3 =& 27 \\
\sqrt[3]{x^3} =& \sqrt[3]{27} \\
x =& 3
\end{aligned}
$$

## POLYNOMIALS

First, a `term` is a mathematical expression made up of two parts
(a number part and a variable part).  The number part is called the coefficient.
For example a term can be $6y$ or $6y^2$.

A polynomial is a combination of terms linked together by
addition or subtraction.

* One term - monomial
* Two terms - binomial (aka polynomial)
* Three terms - trinomial (aka polynomial)
* Four or more terms - polynomial

Example of a polynomial,

$$
3x^2 + x - 5
$$

But why does the $x$ not have a number part and the 5 not have a variable part?
Well think of $x$ as $1x$ and $5$ as  $5x^0$. Hence,

$$
\boxed{3x^2 + 1x - 5x^0}
$$

The `degree` of a polynomial is determined by the power of the
variable part. $5x^4$ would be a forth degree term.

Polynomials are often referred to by the degree of the
highest term. Hence, $7x^4 + 3y^2$ would be a 4th degree polynomial.
Arrange the polynomial from highest to lowest terms. As an example,

$$
7x^4 + 3y^2 + x + 5
$$

But what about $3 + 7x - 5x^2$?  It would be,

$$
-5x^2 + 7x + 3
$$

## SIMPLIFYING POLYNOMIALS

Simplify by making polynomial shorter. Combining like terms
(same variable parts),

$$
\begin{aligned}
&2x^3 + 4x^2 + 3x^2 + 5x \\
&2x^3 + (4+3)x^2 + 5x \\
&2x^3 + 7x^2 + 5x
\end{aligned}
$$

## DISTRIBUTIVE PROPERTY

Its like the distributive property in arithmetic
$a(b+c) = ab+ac$ or $a(b-c) = ab-ac$.

Take a `factor` and `distribute` it to the terms,

As an example with $3$ as a factor,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& 3(x+6) \\
& 3x +18
\end{aligned}
$$

As another example with $x$ as a factor,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& x(x^2-8x+2) \\
& x^3-8x^2+2x
\end{aligned}
$$

In reverse you can `factor out` something.

## GRAPHING EQUATIONS ON A COORDINATE PLANE

A coordinate plane has an $x$ and $y$ axis.

### LINEAR EQUATIONS

Form straight lines when you graph.

### QUADRATIC EQUATIONS

Form curves when graphs.
