## OVERVIEW - THE UNKNOWN

Algebra is a lot like arithmetic.
But algebra introduces the element of the unknown values,

$$
1 + 2 = unknown
$$

or

$$
1 + 2 = x
$$

Where $x$ is a placeholder for a number we don't know yet.
The equation is telling us the known and unknown values.
One of the main goals of algebra is to `solve the equation`.
To find out what the unknown is,

$$
\begin{aligned}
1 + 2 =& x \\
3 =& x \\
x =& 3
\end{aligned}
$$

## VARIABLES

$$
a + b = 2
$$

So if $a = 2$, then $b = 0$.  $b$ will change depending on $a$.
And visa versa.

## MAKES THINGS SIMPLE - MULTIPLICATION

Multiplication is implied.

Instead of,

$$
a*b + c*d=10
$$

Its easier to do,

$$
ab + cd = 10
$$

Since we do grouping,

$$
(a+b)(c+d)=10
$$

We can use that for multiplication on numbers. So instead of,

$$
2*5 = 10
$$

Its cleaner to do,

$$
2(5) = 10
$$

## HOW TO SOLVE SIMPLE EQUATIONS WITH ONE OPERATIONS (REARRANGEMENT)

Figuring out the unknowns via rearrangement.  Equations
must always by balanced.  Just do the same things to both sides
of the equation.

Addition (_add 5 on each side_)

$$
\begin{aligned}
x-5 =& 16 \\
(5)+x-5 =& 16+(5) \\
x =& 21
\end{aligned}
$$

Subtraction _(subtract 7 from each side)_,

$$
\begin{aligned}
x+7 =& 15 \\
(-7)+x+7 =& 15+(-7) \\
x =& 8
\end{aligned}
$$

Dealing with $-x$, _(add $x$ on each side)_,

$$
\begin{aligned}
12-x =& 5 \\
(x) + 12-x =& 5 + (x)  \\
12 =& 5+x \\
(-5)+12 =& 5+x+(-5) \\
7 =& x \\
x =& 7
\end{aligned}
$$

Division _(divide by 3 on each side)_,

$$
\begin{aligned}
3x =& 15 \\
\frac{3x}{(3)} =& \frac{15}{(3)} \\
x =& 5 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Multiplication _(multiply by 2 on each side)_,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{x}{2} =& 3 \\
(2)\frac{x}{2} =& 3(2) \\
x =& 6
\end{aligned}
$$

Multiplication _(multiply by x on each side)_,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{4}{x} =& 2 \\
(x)\frac{4}{x} =& 2(x) \\
4 =& 2x \\
\frac{4}{(2)} =& \frac{2x}{(2)} \\
2 =& x \\
x =& 2
\end{aligned}
$$

## HOW TO SOLVE SIMPLE EQUATIONS WITH TWO OPERATIONS (REARRANGEMENT)

Also called 2-step equations.  When solving multi step operations
revers the oder of operations rule, which is,

* $()$ and Groups
* Exponents and Radicals
* $/$ $*$
* $+$ $-$

Addition & Multiplication _(use subtraction and then division)_,

$$
\begin{aligned}
2x + 2 =& 8 \\
(-2) + 2x + 2 =& 8 + (-2) \\
2x =& 6 \\
\frac{2x}{(2)} =& \frac{6}{(2)} \\
x =& 3
\end{aligned}
$$

## GRAPHING EQUATIONS

Easier to see when you take algebraic equations and graphic there solutions.

### LINEAR EQUATIONS

Form straight lines when you graph.

### QUADRATIC EQUATIONS

Form curves when graphs.
