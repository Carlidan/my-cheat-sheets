This cheat sheet was built using,

* LaTex Math Mode equations rendered to images using
  [readme2tex-pgfplots](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/readme2tex-pgfplots)
* Graphs were created in
  [my-latex-graphs](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-latex-graphs)
  repo using the LaTeX graph packages

## OVERVIEW

Why are things the way they are, we try to understand.

* `mass` - _tbd_
* `velocity` - _tbd_
* `acceleration` - _tbd_
* `kinetic energy`
* `electric field`
* `gravity`
* `vector` - _Has a magnitude (size) and a direction_
* `scalar` - _Only has a magnitude (size)_

## TERMS

## VECTORS AND SCALARS

Let look at Moving a brick.

If I said I moved a brick 5 meters.  The 5 meters (distance) is a scalar.

If I said it moved 5 meters to the left, now I have a direction,
so this is a vector.  The magnitude is 5 meters and the direction is to the left.

Now lets add time. What is I said I moved a brick to the left 5 meters and
it took 2 seconds.

Velocity is it moved 5 meters in 2 seconds, or <img alt="$v = 2.5 m/s$" src="svgs/c307242077f37ce08590fb2a4dd1e830.svg" align="middle" width="81.568575pt" height="24.56553pt"/>
So velocity is a scalar.

But if I also tell you the direction, that is a vector and its velocity.
