## OVERVIEW

Why are things the way they are, we try to understand.

* mass - __
* velocity - _asdfadsfasdf_
* acceleration - __
* kinetic energy
* electric field
* gravity
* vector has a magnitude (size) and a direction
* Scalar only has a magitue (size)

## TERMS

## VECTORS AND SCALARS

Let look at Moving a brick.

If I said I moved a brick 5 meters.  The 5 meters (distance) is a scalar.

If I said it moved 5 meters to the left, now I have a direction,
so this is a vector.  The magnitude is 5 meters and the direction is to the left.

Now lets add time. What is I said I moved a brick to the left 5 meters and
it took 2 seconds.

Velocity is it moved 5 meters in 2 seconds, or $v = 2.5 m/s$
So velocity is a scalar.

But if I also tell you the direction, that is a vector and its velocity.
