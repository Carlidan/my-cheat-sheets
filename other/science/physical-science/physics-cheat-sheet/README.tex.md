`physics` _helps describe everything around us._

This cheat sheet was built using,

* LaTex Math Mode equations rendered to images using
  [readme2tex-pgfplots](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/readme2tex-pgfplots)
* Graphs were created in
  [my-latex-graphs](https://github.com/JeffDeCola/my-latex-graphs)
  repo using the LaTeX graph packages

## OVERVIEW

Why are things the way they are, we try to understand.
IT is the study of the properties of matter and their relationship with energy
and forces.

Physics can be subdivided into the following,

* `CLASSICAL PHYSICS`
  * This cheat sheet
  * Isaac Newton is credited with many classical physics theories.
  * This is further broken down into
    * `MATTER`
      * The various states of matter and their properties.
    * `MECHANICS`
      * Concerns forces and the motion of objects.
    * `WAVE MOTION`
      * Special application of mechanics. It mainly concerns sound    waves
        and electromagnetic waves.
    * `HEAT ENERGY`
      * Heat is the internal energy of a material.
    * `ELECTRICITY AND MAGNETISM`
      * General electricity
      * Static electricity
      * Direct current (DC) electricity
      * Alternating current (AC) electricity
      * Magnetism
      * Electromagnetism
    * `GRAVITY`
      * Concerns the force of gravity near the Earth and the forces
        of gravitation in space.
* `RELATIVITY`
  * Concerns what happens to matter, space, and time at extremely high speeds
  or velocities.
* `QUANTUM MECHANICS`
  * Concerns extremely small sizes and distances

## BASIC QUANTITIES

Basic quantities and how they interact are,

* `Motion`
  * `VELOCITY`
  * The rate of change of its position with respect to a frame of reference,
    and is a function of time
  * `ACCELERATION`
    * Rate of change of velocity of an object with respect to time.
* `ELECTRIC CHARGE`
  * Is the physical property of matter that can experience a force
    when placed in an electromagnetic field.
  * Has an `electric field`
  * When moving produces a `magnetic field`
  * Can flow though a `circuit`.
* `ENERGY`
  * Must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on, or to heat,
    the object
  * Concerns the velocity of matter
  * Capacity to do `work`
* `ENTROPY`
* `FORCE`
  * Is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object
  * Such as `gravity`
* `LENGTH`
  * Measure of distance
* `MASS`
  * Both a property of a physical body and
  * A measure of its resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion)
    when a net force is applied
* `MATTER`
  * `Objects` that have mass a volume (take up space)
* `MOMENTUM`
  * Product of the mass and `velocity` of an `object`
* `POTENTIAL ENERGY`
  * Is the `energy` held by an `object` because of its position relative
    to other `objects`
* `SPACE`
  * Is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which `objects`
    and events have relative position and direction.
* `TEMPERATURE`
  * Is a physical quantity expressing `hot` and `cold`
* `TIME`
