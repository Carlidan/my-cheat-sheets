## BRIEF HISTORY OF ASTRONOMY

This is a brief history of the major players that started
modern science.  And sadly, the church fought them
and arrested some along the way.  But
knowledge and truth will always win, you just need to always fight.

### NICOLAUS COPERNICUS (1473-1543) POLISH

He was really the first guy to determine the earth is not the
center of the universe.  But he did everything in secret
his entire life because he worked for the church.
Using just his eyes he watched the sky and determined
the sun was the center (heliocentric) of the universe of the time.
His book `On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres` was published
just before his death in 1543.  The book/work was denounced
by the church in 1616.

His major contributions are,

* All sphere revolve around sun
* Distance earth sun small comparison to stars
* Earth moves where sky remains unchanged
* What appears as the sun moving, is actually the earth

### TYCHO BRAHE (1546-1601) DANISH

Wanted to record the accurate planetary positions.
Like Copernicus no telescopes, just eyes. Worked with Kepler.

* Most accurate observations of tracking planetary bodies

But he still believed earth revolved around sun.  He was very
tied to the church.

#### JOHANNES KEPLER (1571-1630) GERMAN

Sick a frail child. Math teacher. Very religious.
Wanted to find gods work. Worked for Brahe to
actually predict where Mars would be in the sky at
any giving time.  Wrote his masterpiece `Astronomia Nova`
on his work.

* Continued work by Copernicus
* Work on planetary bodies
* Model of universe based on geometric shapes
 (wrong) but great guess
* Mathematically predicted position of mars in sky
* He did not like Brahe's model and rejected it

Had three main contributions,

* Planets travel elliptical
* Closer you are to sun move faster
* The square of the orbital period of a planet
  is proportional to distance of the sun cubed.

### GALILEO GALILEI (1564-1642)  ITALY

Father of observational astronomy and physics
and father of scientific method and modern science.
He was arrogant. His book
`Dialog Concerning the Two Chief World Systems` got him arrested.
Banned until 1718.

* Used and built primitive telescope
* Found Jupiter moons. Observational evidence.
* Not everything orbited around the earth
* Did not like Kepler or his laws

### SIR ISSAC NEWTON (1642-1727) ENGLISH

His book `Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy`,
published in 1687 laid foundation of classical mechanics.
Apple falling from tree is a fairy tail he made up.

* Newtons 3 Laws of Motion
* Universal Gravitation (Superseded by Theory of relativity)
* Built a new type of telescope
* Helped pave the way for calculus
* Worked with Halley studying a comet (Halley's comet) and
  predicted when it would come back

## HOW TO MODEL THE STARS FROM EARTH

The `Celestial sphere` is a sphere around the earth that make the
stars appear to occupy fixed positions relative to each other.
The north pole is the north of the sphere. Its a good model.
There is a `celestial equator`.

The `zenith` is the point directly above the observer.
90&deg; from any point on horizon.

The `Meridian` passes through the `zenith` and both
`celestial sphere` poles. Perpendicular to `celestial equator`.

The `Ecliptic` is the Apparent path of suns motion on the `celestial sphere`.
Plane of our solar system.

## FINDING A STAR ON CELESTIAL SPHERE (DECLINATION AND RIGHT ASCENSION)

You need two coordinated to find a star, declination
and right ascension.

`Declination` is like latitude on earth.
The angle of the star form the celestial equator.
The north star would be 90&deg;.  It would be written like,

`-2`&deg;` 49' 11"` (degrees, arc minutes and arc seconds).

`Right ascension` is like longitude on the earth. The zero
point is the spring equinox. It would be written like,

`5h 41m 28s` (hours, minutes and seconds).
