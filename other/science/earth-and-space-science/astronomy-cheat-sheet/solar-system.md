## ASTRONOMICAL UNITS AND SCALE

An astronomical unit (AU) represents the mean distance between
the Earth and our sun. An AU is approximately 93 million miles (150 million km).
It's approximately 8 light-minutes. More exactly,

* 1 AU = 92,955,807 miles (149,597,871 km).

## SOLAR SYSTEM

* ?? AU from the sun
* 99.86% of the system’s mass is found in the Sun and the majority of the
  remaining 0.14% is contained within the solar system’s eight planets.
* The four smaller inner planets, also known as the “terrestrial planets”
  (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars), are primarily composed of rock and metal.
* The four outer planets, also known as the “gas giants”
  (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune), are substantially
  larger and more massive than the inner planets.
* Other objects of note in the Solar System are the dwarf planets
  (Ceres, Pluto, Haumea, Makemake & Eris), moons, asteroids,
  the asteroid belt, comets and the Kuiper belt.

## SUN

Our sun, in the grand scheme of things, the sun is not very large,
not very hot.

* About 4.5 billions years old
* Yellow dwarf
* Radius is 700,000 KM
* Nuclear fusion of hydrogen to helium
* Cross section,
  * Core 15 Million degrees
  * Radiative Zone
  * Convective Zone
  * Photosphere
  * Chromosphere - Atmosphere    
  * Corona - Upper atmosphere

## INNER PLANETS

?? AU from the sun
The four smaller inner planets, also known as the “terrestrial planets”
(Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars), are primarily composed of rock and metal.

### MERCURY

* Distance: .39 AU from the sun
* Orbit Period: 88 days to orbit the sun
* Rotate Axis: 176 days
* Surface Temperature: 427&deg;C to -173&deg;C
* Diameter: 4,879 km 
* Mass: 5.5% of earth
* Moons: None
* Notable facts:
  * Little atmosphere
  * Most eccentric orbit (big eclipse)
  * Your weight on Mercury would be 38% of your weight on Earth
  * Smallest planet
  * Only two spacecraft have ever visited Mercury.

### VENUS

* ?? AUs from the sun
* 225 days to orbit the sun
* 243 days to rotate on axis
* Co2 is at 96.5%, whereas earth is .04%
  * These levels trap heat which causes greenhouse effect
  * Temp is 462&deg;C
* Pressure is 90 times of earth
* Aside from sun and moon, brightest object in sky

### EARTH

* 1 AU from the sun (amazing)
* 365.24 days to orbit the sun
* 1 days to rotate on axis (what a coincidence)

#### THE MOON

* 27 days to orbit the earth
* Copernicus and Brahe have craters named after them
* Synchronous rotation
* We think Formed by another planet (thea) hitting the earth
  * To big to be just passing by and caught in orbit
* Formed 30-50 million after the solar system.

### MARS

* ?? AU from the sun
* About 2 years (687 days) to orbit the sun
* 24.6 rotate on axis
* Thin atmosphere of C02 and can reach -5&deg; in daylight

## THE ASTEROID BELT

* ?? AU from the sun
* Millions of asteroids in this belt
* 200 known asteroids are larger than 100km
* Ceres is dwarf planet like Pluto

## OUTER PLANETS

* ?? AU from the sun
The four outer planets, also known as the “gas giants”
(Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune), are substantially
larger and more massive than the inner planets.

### JUPITER

* ?? AU from the sun
* 433 days to orbit sun
* 10 hours to rotate on axis
* The King of Planets
* The red dot is a storm that has been ragging for over 300 years.
* 67 Moons
  * Gallileo discovered 4 of them.
* Mainly composed mainly of hydrogen and helium

### SATURN

* 30 years to orbit sun
* 10 hours to rotate on axis
* Furthest planet we can see with naked eye from earth
* Largest moon is titan
* Mainly composed mainly of hydrogen and helium

### URANUS

* 84 years to orbit sun
* 243 days to rotate on axis
* Can't be seen by naked eye
* Axis is at 98&deg;, Pole always faces the sun
* All 27 moons named after Shakespearean characters 

### NEPTUNE

* 165 years to orbit sun
* 15 hours to rotate on axis
* Extreme weather

## DWARF PLANETS

A celestial body resembling a small planet
but lacking certain technical criteria that
are required for it to be classed as such

### PLUTO

* ?? AU from the sun
* 248 years to orbit sun
* 6.4 days to rotate on axis
* De-classified in 2006
* Has 5 moons
* Pluto's orbit is off, so it seems Pluto was captured by the sun

### ERIS

* ?? AU from the sun
* 558 years to orbit sun

### HAUMEA

* ?? AU from the sun
* 285 years orbit

## KUIPER BELT

* 30-55 AU from the sun
* Lots of stuff and its huge
* Chunks of ice
* More dwarf Planets
* Commits
* Stretches across 20 astronomical units (AU) of space
* Area of the outer solar system

## OORT CLOUD

* ?? AU from the sun
* Bubble around our solar system

* Trillions of objects our there
* Extended shell of icy objects that exist
  in the outermost reaches of the solar system
