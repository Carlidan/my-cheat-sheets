## SUN

Our sun, in the grand scheme of things, the sun is not very large,
not very hot.

* About 4.5 billions years old
* Yellow dwarf
* Radius is 700,000 KM
* Nuclear fusion of hydrogen to helium
* Cross section,
  * Core 15 Million degrees
  * Radiative Zone
  * Convective Zone
  * Photosphere
  * Chromosphere - Atmosphere    
  * Corona - Upper atmosphere

## MERCURY

* 88 days to orbit
* ?? data rotate rotate on axis
* Little atmosphere
* Big Surface temperature swings can be 427&deg;C to -173&deg;C
* Most eccentric orbit (big eclipse)

## VENUS

* 225 days to orbit sun
* 243 days to rotate on axis
* Co2 is at 96.5%, whereas earth is .04%
  * These levels trap heat which causes greenhouse effect
  * Temp is 462&deg;C
* Pressure is 90 times of earth
* Aside from sun and moon, brightest object in sky

## EARTH

* 365 days to orbit sun
* 1 days to rotate on axis (what a coincidence)

### THE MOON

* 27 days to orbit earth
* Copernicus and Brahe have craters named after them
* Synchronous rotation
* We think Formed by another planet (thea) hitting the earth
  * To big to be just passing by and caught in orbit
* Formed 30-50 million after the solar system.

## MARS

* About 2 years to orbit sun
* 24.6 rotate on axis
* Thin atmosphere of C02 and can reach -5&deg; in daylight

## THE ASTEROID BELT

* Millions of asteroids in this belt
* 200 known asteroids are larger than 100km
* Ceres is dwarf planet like Pluto

## JUPITER

* 433 days to orbit sun
* 10 hours to rotate on axis
* The King of Planets
* The red dot is a storm that has been ragging for over 300 years.
* 67 Moons
  * Gallileo discovered 4 of them.

## SATURN

* 30 years to orbit sun
* 10 hours to rotate on axis
* Furthest planet we can see with naked eye from earth
* Largest moon is titan

## URANUS

* 84 years to orbit sun
* 243 days to rotate on axis
* Can't be seen by naked eye
* Axis is at 98&deg;, Pole always faces the sun
* All 27 moons named after Shakespearean characters 

## NEPTUNE

* 165 years to orbit sun
* 15 hours to rotate on axis
* Extreme weather

## DWARF PLANETS

A celestial body resembling a small planet
but lacking certain technical criteria that
are required for it to be classed as such

### PLUTO

* 248 years to orbit sun
* 6.4 days to rotate on axis
* De-classified in 2006
* Has 5 moons
* Pluto's orbit is off, so it seems Pluto was captured by the sun

### ERIS

* 558 years to orbit sun

### HAUMEA

* 285 years orbit

## KUIPER BELT

* Lots of stuff and its huge
* Chunks of ice
* More dwarf Planets
* Commits

## OORT CLOUD

* Bubble around our solar system
* Huge region (Most of our solar system)
* Trillions of objects our there
* Extended shell of icy objects that exist
  in the outermost reaches of the solar system
